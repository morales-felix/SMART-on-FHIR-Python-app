### Steps to Use  

1. Launch the App: Click the link above.
2. If patient and provider ID is known:

    - On the right-hand side you'll see options to select Patient and Provider: Select your patient and provider then click the blue launch button on the bottom of the screen.

3. If patient and provider ID is not known:

    - First click the blue launch button at the bottom of the screen and leave the patient and provider section blank. You'll be redirected to choose a provider and patient by name instead.

4. View Information: The app will display the selected Patient's name and a list of their Observations.

You can select any combination of Patient and Provider. No need to choose an Encounter.  
  
### Types of Launches  

- Standalone Launch: Click "Launch" without pre-selecting a Patient and Provider (i.e., without giving "context" to the app). You'll be prompted to choose them (i.e., give context) after launching.
- EHR Launch: Select a Patient and Provider before clicking "Launch". Essentially, the app launches with "context" provided.

Feel free to explore and see how the app works with different Patients and Providers!
